            <h3>American Democrats released dozens of photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including some of <b> Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and the former Prince Andrew. (1/3)</b></h3>
            <p>
                Many photos of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and former Prince Andrew in Jeffrey Epstein's house is now released by Democratic lawmakers on the <i> House Oversight Committee. </i> Anticipation is also growing as the <b>Trump administration </b> faces a deadline next week to produce and release the Epstein files to the public. </p>
            
                
                
                <h3>Republican lawmakers tell Trump something he’s not used to hearing: <b>No</b> (2/3)</h3>
                <p> The GOP lawmakers issued an unusual defiance against President Donald Trump. Resistance is evident at both the state and federal levels this week. Most glaring this week is a narrow majority of Republican state senators in Indiana voted on Thursday to reject Trump's pressure to redraw a their congressional map into a gerrymandered congressional map aiming to give the Republican party 2 seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
                <h3>The President Donald Trump had been sued by the <b>National Trust for Historic Preservation</b> over Ballroom (3/3)</h3>
                <p>
                    National Trust for Historic Preservation has filed a federal lawsuit aimed to stop the construction of President Trump’s ballroom at the White House. The White House’s East Wing has already been demolished to make way for the ballroom.

            <h2>December 12, 2025</h2>

            <h3>United States issues new sanctions against <b>Maduro's family and Oil sector</b> (1/3)</h3>
            <p>The Donald Trump Administration is increasing its pressure on <b>President Maduro of Venezuela</b> after seizing an oil tanker off the coast. Venezuela relies heavily on oil, leading Mr. Maduro's administration to smuggle crude oil to countries like <i>Iran, China, and others.</i> Trump allegedly said it was tied to terrorist groups.</p>
            
            <h3>Trump plans to loosen restrictions on <b>marijuana</b> (2/3)</h3>
            <p>President Trump is expected to loosen restrictions on marijuana by moving it to Schedule III—similar to common prescription drugs. He discussed the plan with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana). The move wouldn't legalize or decriminalize marijuana but would ease research barriers.</p>
            
            <h3>Donald Trump led Republicans to power in 2024, <b>2026</b> might be a different story</h3>
            <p>Trump failed to persuade Indiana state senators to vote on a new gerrymandered map meant to help Republicans gain seats. More concerning for Republicans is Trump's slipping support on the issues that helped him win 2024. He dismissed concerns, telling Politico he gave himself "A+++++" on the economy.</p>

            <p>On December 11, 2025 <b>Maria Corina Machado</b> was in Oslo vowing to finally end President Nicolas Maduro's time in office. The <i>Donald Trump Administration</i> is also pressuring Maduro's presidency to end because of accusations by the Administration of flooding America with drugs.</p>
            
            <h3>A United States Admiral killed <b>2</b> boat strike survivors (2/3)</h3>
            <p>An order allegedly given by <b>Admiral Frank Bradley</b> is under scrutiny by the <i>American Congress</i>. Congress passed a Pentagon Bill pressuring <b>Hegseth</b> to release evidence of the boat strike incident.</p>
